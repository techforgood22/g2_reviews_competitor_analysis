They often take 1 hour to get back. It can make it a bit cumbersome if you're back to back with meetings and have to go back in to send those recordings out to prospects instead of doing that right after the meeting ends.

I really appreciate that I don't have to remember to click record and I can trust that the meetings are being automatically recorded. The new summary tools are helpful, especially after a busy day of back-to-back meetings.

I love being able to go to the call and seeing a recap of everything in one place. I also like that it provides transparency within our organization and allows me to go back and watch other people's calls for learning purposes.

I also like the insights and reporting features, which can help me improve my sales skills. I haven't yet extracted any reports, but I understand that this is not yet possible. I would recommend that Gong provide e-handouts or digital training materials on how to extract reports to end users during the migration training. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">I think Gong's chat differentiator is a great feature, but it could be improved by adding the following:\n",

            "</p><p class=\"formatted-text\">- Color coding the responses of the participants in a long monologue. This would make it easier to see who is saying what, especially when the transcript auto-scrolls down. I think this is already a feature implemented but needs further improvement.\n",

Previously, our internal tool does help in terms of simple transcription which by the way is 70-80% accurate. But when our client saw the value of Gong they rolled it out fast and got implemented for usage. We were offered multiple internal training sesssions which is good but if training materials, like infographics on quick usage tips are often handed down on top of townhall trainings, it would be a nice to have. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div></div>, <div itemprop=\"reviewBody\"><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you like best about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Gong has become an integral part of my work. I don't know if I could function without it. It really aids in helping me draft follow up emails after check in calls with clients. It makes me look really on top of my game! I use it every single day. It's also amazing how easy it is to search your calls for key words or phrases. We also use it internally to train new members of our team.

The most interesting thing with Gong is that it automatically transcribes calls well. Such a feature saves me a lot of time, especially if I have to go back to some details discussed in these conversations. The way Gong describes each call is remarkable – one almost feels like he is reading between the lines! It assists in improving my presentation skills by enabling me to record the entire script of conversations that I share with clients related to finance. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Yet, let me confess, for the first time using Gong, the number of functions seemed a bit excessive.

All of my calls are automatically recorded. This makes it easy to revisit afterwards, being in a customer-facing role it's important to be able to repurpose recordings.

Their dashboard is much easier to read and collaborate in than any report in Salesforce. Gong gives both our sales reps and our sales leaders more immediate visibility into our sales pipeline and instantly helps find gaps, so you can manage deals more efficiently and effectively. Their CS team is quick to respond and support.I loved our CS rep and she's been incredibly helpful over the past 1.5 years we've had Gong. She's quick to alert me to new features we maybe aren't taking advantage of and is able to get me up to speed on quick 15-20 minute calls, as she knows how little time we have. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Onboarding was a self-service model when we first onboarding and that took longer than expected due to time constraints. I would have liked more hand-holding as we started to stand this up. Pricing is high for smaller companies, making it a large chunk of your sales software budget.\n",

The easy-to-read reports and dashboards make it easy for even new reps to dig in and discover what they can do more/less of and it gives leadership easy visibility into what's happening, rep-by-rep. This is saving us time, helping us have more valuable 1:1 sales check-ins and, helps us turn good calls/content into client testimonials that our marketing team is using to drive more qualified inbound leads. The Gong library is also used to help train and scale new reps. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div></div>, <div itemprop=\"reviewBody\"><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you like best about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Recently, one of my most loved features is the ability to give and request feedback from teammates.

The most interesting thing with Gong is that it automatically transcribes calls well. Such a feature saves me a lot of time, especially if I have to go back to some details discussed in these conversations. The way Gong describes each call is remarkable – one almost feels like he is reading between the lines! It assists in improving my presentation skills by enabling me to record the entire script of conversations that I share with clients related to finance. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Yet, let me confess, for the first time using Gong, the number of functions seemed a bit excessive.

All of my calls are automatically recorded. This makes it easy to revisit afterwards, being in a customer-facing role it's important to be able to repurpose recordings. Additionally, the transcript and AI feature make it easy to find questions or follow up items in seconds! <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Waiting for calls to analyze, but by no means is this a dealbreaker. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div class=\"expanded-review-9548248 is-hidden-default\"><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What problems is Gong solving and how is that benefiting you?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Recording all communication with clients. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div></div>, <div itemprop=\"reviewBody\"><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you like best about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Gong's forecasting and reporting truly simplifies what's going on within your business from a sales perspective. Their dashboard is much easier to read and collaborate in than any report in Salesforce. Gong gives both our sales reps and our sales leaders more immediate visibility into our sales pipeline and instantly helps find gaps, so you can manage deals more efficiently and effectively. Their CS team is quick to respond and support.I loved our CS rep and she's been incredibly helpful over the past 1.5 years we've had Gong. She's quick to alert me to new features we maybe aren't taking advantage of and is able to get me up to speed on quick 15-20 minute calls, as she knows how little time we have. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Onboarding was a self-service model when we first onboarding and that took longer than expected due to time constraints. I would have liked more hand-holding as we started to stand this up. Pricing is high for smaller companies, making it a large chunk of your sales software budget.\n",

The easy-to-read reports and dashboards make it easy for even new reps to dig in and discover what they can do more/less of and it gives leadership easy visibility into what's happening, rep-by-rep. This is saving us time, helping us have more valuable 1:1 sales check-ins and, helps us turn good calls/content into client testimonials that our marketing team is using to drive more qualified inbound leads. The Gong library is also used to help train and scale new reps. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div></div>, <div itemprop=\"reviewBody\"><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you like best about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Recently, one of my most loved features is the ability to give and request feedback from teammates.

The most interesting thing with Gong is that it automatically transcribes calls well. Such a feature saves me a lot of time, especially if I have to go back to some details discussed in these conversations. The way Gong describes each call is remarkable – one almost feels like he is reading between the lines! It assists in improving my presentation skills by enabling me to record the entire script of conversations that I share with clients related to finance. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Yet, let me confess, for the first time using Gong, the number of functions seemed a bit excessive.

All of my calls are automatically recorded. This makes it easy to revisit afterwards, being in a customer-facing role it's important to be able to repurpose recordings. Additionally, the transcript and AI feature make it easy to find questions or follow up items in seconds! <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Waiting for calls to analyze, but by no means is this a dealbreaker. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div class=\"expanded-review-9548248 is-hidden-default\"><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What problems is Gong solving and how is that benefiting you?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Recording all communication with clients. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div></div>, <div itemprop=\"reviewBody\"><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you like best about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Gong's forecasting and reporting truly simplifies what's going on within your business from a sales perspective. Their dashboard is much easier to read and collaborate in than any report in Salesforce. Gong gives both our sales reps and our sales leaders more immediate visibility into our sales pipeline and instantly helps find gaps, so you can manage deals more efficiently and effectively. Their CS team is quick to respond and support.I loved our CS rep and she's been incredibly helpful over the past 1.5 years we've had Gong. She's quick to alert me to new features we maybe aren't taking advantage of and is able to get me up to speed on quick 15-20 minute calls, as she knows how little time we have. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you dislike about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Onboarding was a self-service model when we first onboarding and that took longer than expected due to time constraints. I would have liked more hand-holding as we started to stand this up. Pricing is high for smaller companies, making it a large chunk of your sales software budget.\n",

The easy-to-read reports and dashboards make it easy for even new reps to dig in and discover what they can do more/less of and it gives leadership easy visibility into what's happening, rep-by-rep. This is saving us time, helping us have more valuable 1:1 sales check-ins and, helps us turn good calls/content into client testimonials that our marketing team is using to drive more qualified inbound leads. The Gong library is also used to help train and scale new reps. <span class=\"spht\">Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.</span></p></div></div></div>, <div itemprop=\"reviewBody\"><div><div class=\"l5 mt-2\">What do you like best about Gong?</div><div><p class=\"formatted-text\">Recently, one of my most loved features is the ability to give and request feedback from teammates.

Being able to quickly review a call to help with notes and recap emails allows me to give my full attention to a conversation and saves time when I'm sending follow ups as well.

Their CS team is quick to respond and support.I loved our CS rep and she's been incredibly helpful over the past 1.5 years we've had Gong.

It now has some nice AI features and funcionality which is really beneficial It has a lot of integration otpions too Review collected by and hosted on G2com When I started with my new company this easy to use tool was offered to me to be able to study successful peers in the pursuit of their goals It was really easy to integrate into daily use because it has an extremely simple interface and it was easy to find the information I was looking for It allows our teams to review conversations from active deal cycles go back and understand what may have gone wrong in past deal cycles and overall see data on how reps perform on live meetings Review collected by and hosted on G2com It has been very helpful in terms of keeping yourself upto date on tasks and to dos Its AI is very helpful in creating follow ups and summarizing events that took place Review collected by and hosted on G2com I like artificial intelligence and how it helps me better understand how to approach my coaching sessions Review collected by and hosted on G2com Dealboard  quickly and efficiently look at the health of accounts and recent interactions CRM enhancements allow sales reps to even manage their pipelines easier Review collected by and hosted on G2com There are rarely if ever any technical issues with the recordings or the quality of recorded calls The audio and video work well and the recent call summaries are an absolute gamechanger and timesaver when looking at old calls Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong is so userfriendly that anyone can use it Saves time with onboarding new employees It helps us to get to the root of our customers and prospects problems The UX is unmatched and the Gong Academy is so helpful Love love love Gong Review collected by and hosted on G2com the filtering capabilities for the withincall text are not only superb but unlike other software Ive used I really like to use gong for my business calls The main advantage is the fact that i do not have to make notes while i speak with clients I often use the gong recordings to prepare my calls I use Gong everyday It is easy integrated and easy to use Review collected by and hosted on G2com Super easy to use and great to have all previous recordings in one place The analytics provided from those calls provide helpful insight as to how to improve and monitor performance Review collected by and hosted on G2com I like how I can easily pull up a customer and view all calls notes ect and then ask it any question or have it write me a follow up email Review collected by and hosted on G2com I use Gong every day for customer meetings I really appreciate that I dont have to remember to click record and I can trust that the meetings are being automatically recorded The new summary tools are helpful especially after a busy day of backtoback meetings I only use the reporting a couple times a week but I like that we can set up trackers and easily find calls that have specific keywords Review collected by and hosted on G2com Can view all the details about the call on one page the notes the next steps the video and transcript and can also see how long each person spoke and when screen sharing startedended Review collected by and hosted on G2com I enjoy using Gong because it is easy to use and allows me to go back and review calls At the end of each call it provides a brief summary I can use in order to create a recap email for my clients It also identifies action items from my calls I can use in order to keep track of what all I need to do following a call Review collected by and hosted on G2com  super user friendly know exactly where to go I am impressed with the accuracy of Gongs voicetotext transcription which is at 95 I also like the insights and reporting features which can help me improve my sales skills I havent yet extracted any reports but I understand that this is not yet possible I would recommend that Gong provide ehandouts or digital training materials on how to extract reports to end users during the migration training Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong has become an integral part of my work I dont know if I could function without it It really aids in helping me draft follow up emails after check in calls with clients It makes me look really on top of my game I use it every single day Its also amazing how easy it is to search your calls for key words or phrases We also use it internally to train new members of our team Highly highly recommend Review collected by and hosted on G2com I love how the notetaker is automatically added to my calls so I dont have to rememeber to record I also love the built in AI summaries and the reminders on follow up tasks and todos Sharing with customers is also easy Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong has been a very useful tool for me as someone involved in the financial sector The most interesting thing with Gong is that it automatically transcribes calls well Such a feature saves me a lot of time especially if I have to go back to some details discussed in these conversations The way Gong describes each call is remarkable  one almost feels like he is reading between the lines It assists in improving my presentation skills by enabling me to record the entire script of conversations that I share with clients related to finance Review collected by and hosted on G2com The most helpful part of Gong is their integration with Zoom All of my calls are automatically recorded This makes it easy to revisit afterwards being in a customerfacing role its important to be able to repurpose recordings Additionally the transcript and AI feature make it easy to find questions or follow up items in seconds Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gongs forecasting and reporting truly simplifies whats going on within your business from a sales perspective Their dashboard is much easier to read and collaborate in than any report in Salesforce Gong gives both our sales reps and our sales leaders more immediate visibility into our sales pipeline and instantly helps find gaps so you can manage deals more efficiently and effectively Their CS team is quick to respond and supportI loved our CS rep and shes been incredibly helpful over the past 15 years weve had Gong Shes quick to alert me to new features we maybe arent taking advantage of and is able to get me up to speed on quick 1520 minute calls as she knows how little time we have Review collected by and hosted on G2com Recently one of my most loved features is the ability to give and request feedback from teammates Its easy to share a call and they can leave their feedback with timestamps This is great because it gives you the context of the feedback allowing you to communicate your thoughts in a sussinct and easy way Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong allows me to stay engaged in the conversation without having to worry about missing a part to take notes Being able to quickly review a call to help with notes and recap emails allows me to give my full attention to a conversation and saves time when Im sending follow ups as well I also love being able to share snippets with other team members for feedback or to ensure they up to date on the most recent conversations Review collected by and hosted on G2com The recording with timestamps for meeting events is super helpful for review Also the transcript is super helpful allowing you to search by word or reference', 'dislike': 'I feel like it lacks a little bit in staying on top of the game There are other competitors out there that offer more AI funcionality like tracking MEDDPIC and posting notes to a CRM When they add this feature it will be even better Review collected by and hosted on G2com I dont really have any downsides actually I have been able to figure out what I was having trouble with by simple troubleshooting but I know their customer support would be extremely timely in responding to my inquiries if I had them Review collected by and hosted on G2com I cant think of anything in particular that I dislike  Gong has become a vital tool in our toolkit Review collected by and hosted on G2com The attachments tend to be slow in being attached and it does not allow to put excel sheets on the email body Review collected by and hosted on G2com I wish I could also search the calls using the Lead ID from YGL APFM Account I also wish that we can also get an update where Gong can also do Video Screen Recording That will be epic Review collected by and hosted on G2com Not much but I would like some more templates around different methodologies to potentially choose from MEDDICC  consultative selling etc Review collected by and hosted on G2com The transcription process still needs work There are usually multiple incorrect words or phrases that I then have to listen to the call itself to resolve Overall the transcripts are very helpful for a highlevel overview of a call but if I need to get into the weeds Ill have to listen to the call as I cant fully trust the transcription Review collected by and hosted on G2com There is really nothing to dislike about Gong Review collected by and hosted on G2com not a huge fan of the account overview page which shows you all the companys interactions with a specific account I would love to have a better search function so that i can find past calls easier Review collected by and hosted on G2com I cant think of any major problems with Gong It can sometimes be hard to find the  type of call your looking for if you dont know the account name or title of the call This is really not serious though Review collected by and hosted on G2com I wish we were able to get the call recordings faster They often take 1 hour to get back It can make it a bit cumbersome if youre back to back with meetings and have to go back in to send those recordings out to prospects instead of doing that right after the meeting ends I also wish SalesForce tasks showed up in Gong Review collected by and hosted on G2com Not much to dislike about Gong Im excited to see what features they release next Review collected by and hosted on G2com None I can think of right now  going pretty well for now Review collected by and hosted on G2com As far as downsides go the only thing I dont like about Gong is how it speaks about me in third person It will says Holly made introductions and sometimes I wish it used I to refer to me so that I can copy and paste into a recap email Review collected by and hosted on G2com The AI written email followup is not something Id use as its super long and no one will be reading that Review collected by and hosted on G2com I think Gongs chat differentiator is a great feature but it could be improved by adding the following There really isnt anything I dislike about Gong I wish it could take some of my client calls for me haha Review collected by and hosted on G2com I hate how long the calls take to process before the recording is ready that delays my follow up emails to clients and I would prefer to send those as soon as the call wraps up Review collected by and hosted on G2com Yet let me confess for the first time using Gong the number of functions seemed a bit excessive I had to adjust it for months because there is so much to see and do every day Review collected by and hosted on G2com Waiting for calls to analyze but by no means is this a dealbreaker Review collected by and hosted on G2com Onboarding was a selfservice model when we first onboarding and that took longer than expected due to time constraints I would have liked more handholding as we started to stand this up Pricing is high for smaller companies making it a large chunk of your sales software budget Sometimes the calls have a long delay before getting delivered to your inbox Occasionally I send over call recording to my customers so having it delivered in a timely manner is important to me Review collected by and hosted on G2com Updating notes in Deals  if Im making notes on a list of accounts once I save an update the list will reset and it makes it hard to stay on track wiht the accounts are moving around as I save updates Review collected by and hosted on G2com The recordings could be higher quality as sometimes it is hard to read the text of the recordings if there was a screen share Review collected by and hosted on G2com', 'solved_problem': 'Tracking my call recordings and tying htem to my opportunities Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong is helping me implement my best sales abilities so that I can be most successful in my role as a sales development representative Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong is solving the problem that occurs after a video meeting

their call types and customer conversations Review collected by and hosted on G2com Coaching is 1  quick visibility into reps calls and easily searchable transcripts Can quickly ping other members of

manager gain intelligence on prior or prospective customers and learn what others in the sales org do well Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong is helping us to better understand our customers and prospects By hearing exactly what they are saying and when we keep a pulse on what they care about most Review collected by and hosted on G2com coaching on calls in systematic ways I dont have to make notes and i am perfect prepared for the next call  i dont forget things we spoke about Review collected by and hosted on G2com Training and onboarding have been super easy To have access to thousands of your teams calls in one place makes learning a new role and product a breeze Gong helps us in so many ways It alerts us to make sure we dont have prospects that start slipping through the cracks It also helps us close the gap with getting deals to close faster and more effecient Its great for coaching too Review collected by and hosted on G2com We use Gong to record conversations Not only does this help us as individuals but we can also review teammates calls to find new techniques or talking points Review collected by and hosted on G2com Good to see all calls recorded in one place for training and for going back to view calls to assess Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong has helped increase my productivity and save me time I love being able to go to the call and seeing a recap of everything in one place I also like that it provides transparency within our organization and allows me to go back and watch other peoples calls for learning purposes It has helped increase collaboration and in the event that a client has to be transferred it allows for a seamless transition where no detail is missed Review collected by and hosted on G2com Customer experience  Sales Review collected by and hosted on G2com Root cause analysis boost Previously our internal tool does help in terms of simple transcription which by the way is 7080 accurate But when our client saw the value of Gong they rolled it out fast and got implemented for usage We were offered multiple internal training sesssions which is good but if training materials like infographics on quick usage tips are often handed down on top of townhall trainings it would be a nice to have Review collected by and hosted on G2com It keeps me organized with my large book of clients I can draft follow up emails quickly from the summary gong does from each call Review collected by and hosted on G2com Call tracking training and helpful reminders for customers I meet with Review collected by and hosted on G2com Gong has revolutionized problemsolving It enables me to keep track of crucial client interactions so that I do not miss anything This is of great importance to my line of work that
